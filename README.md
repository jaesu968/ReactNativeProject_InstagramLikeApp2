Make an Instagram App (Part Two)
Without a good UI, even an up-and-coming app like Woofstagram won’t attract any users!

This project continues on our previous Woofstagram Sign-up Form, the Instagram for your dogs. We’re going to build the home screen for Woofstagram, with both visual and structural components.

While you go through this project, pay attention to both the code you are writing and the overall styling process: this will help you in future, more complex projects.

One important part of the process is creating reusable components to display app-specific content. It enables us to build flexible, extendable, and visually consistent apps.

Another part of the process, before creating an app, is thinking about the content and features we want to present to users. This not only helps us keep track of our progress, but also helps us structure the components. We’ve provided the intended home screen design via Figma and as an image below, but you are free to implement it using different styling:

The home screen consists of two major items: trending dogs and a list of articles.

Trending dogs are simple styled cards with basic dog information, like name and avatar.
Articles are a secondary feature to provide your users with unique content.
